The purpose of this project is to show the comprehensive skillset I have developed using MYsql. This project consists of a fully functioning professional data warehouse that can upload and transform large amounts of data and prepare it for analytics and support business decisions.


Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture 
**Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
Data Architecture  

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
